Project Overview

The AgriSmart Post-Harvest Tracker is a PL/SQL-based system designed to help Rwandan farmers and small-scale traders reduce post-harvest losses. The system monitors harvested crops, tracks storage conditions (especially humidity), predicts spoilage risks, and provides timely alerts and market suggestions.
By automating decision-making through PL/SQL procedures, triggers, and functions, the system aims to improve food security and increase farmers' income.

Problem Statement

In Rwanda, farmers face significant post-harvest losses due to:

Poor storage conditions, particularly high humidity, which accelerates spoilage.

Delayed market access, where crops remain in storage beyond their safe storage period.

These issues lead to reduced income for farmers and contribute to food insecurity. There is a clear need for a low-cost, automated system that can:

Track harvest and storage timelines.

Monitor humidity levels in real time.

Predict spoilage based on crop type and environmental factors.
Key Objectives
Develop a PL/SQL-Based Monitoring System
Create a functional database system using PL/SQL to track harvested crops, storage conditions, and spoilage risks.

Reduce Post-Harvest Losses
Minimize crop spoilage by providing timely alerts when crops are nearing their spoilage threshold or when storage humidity exceeds safe levels.

Improve Storage Condition Awareness
Continuously monitor and log humidity levels in storage facilities to help farmers maintain optimal conditions.

Enhance Market Access
Match crops with nearby markets that have high demand for specific crop types, helping farmers sell produce before it spoils.

Automate Decision-Making
Use PL/SQL triggers and procedures to automatically generate alerts, predict decay, and suggest actions without manual intervention.

Provide Data-Driven Insights
Simulate post-harvest decay and analyze humidity trends to help farmers make informed decisions about storage and sales.

Support Smallholder Farmers in Rwanda
Tailor the system to the local agricultural context, focusing on low-cost, real-time solutions that are accessible to small-scale farmers and traders.

Demonstrate Practical Application of PL/SQL
Showcase how database programming can be used to solve real-world agricultural and logistical challenges.
